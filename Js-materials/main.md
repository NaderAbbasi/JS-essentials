### Js materials

Below, you can find collection of awesome github repos, podcasts, videos, online reading, blogs, stackoverflow questions, people to follow, etc..which I found useful to grow as a better Javascript developer. 

__NOTE__:The names of links, people, article are totally random, and it has got nothing to do with ranking, I am just putting them in the list as I encounter them. 

Hope you find it useful.
